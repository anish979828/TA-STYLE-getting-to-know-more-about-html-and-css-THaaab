        <p>My decision to be a developer is completely inspired by this guy"Ashh" I cant explain how 
            he was consistent during his his cource of full stack web developement in AltCampus</p>
         <P>Recently He offered in <a href="https://www.vegrow.in/" >@vegrow</a> as senior developer after completing his service of duration 3.5 years in <a href="https://cleartax.in/">@cleartax</a> </P>
            <p>I'm huge fan of his way to doing anything smartly and passionately I'm so lucky to  having a mentor ,a brother &also a good freind like him </p>
